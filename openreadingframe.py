def openreadingframe(fastafile):
	"identify the loongest ORF in the sequence Starts ATG, ends with Stop codon (TAA, TAG, TGA)"
	"""
	 identify all ORFs present in each sequence of the FASTA file, and answer the following questions: 
	 what is the length of the longest ORF in the file? 
	 What is the identifier of the sequence containing the longest ORF? 
	 For a given sequence identifier, what is the longest ORF contained in the sequence represented by that identifier? 
	 What is the starting position of the longest ORF in the sequence that contains it? 
	 The position should indicate the character number in the sequence.
